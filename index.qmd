# Hello! {.unnumbered}

This site/book will serve as a repository for resources related to computational and quantitative workshops held for the University of Minnesota's Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior Graduate Program through its "Friday Noon Seminar" series.

It is a "living document," and thus will be subject to change and be updated over time.
